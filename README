Introduction
-------------
Linux target framework (tgt) aims to simplify various SCSI target
driver (iSCSI, Fibre Channel, SRP, etc) creation and maintenance.

Tgt consists of kernel modules, user-space daemon, and user-space
tools. Some target drivers uses all of them and some use only
user-space daemon and tools (i.e. they completely runs in user space).

Currently, tgt supports three target drivers:

- IBM VIO server (ibmvstgt)
- iSCSI
- Xen vscsifront/back

Note that tgt is under active development. Don't play with important
data.


Preparation
-------------
First, get kernel version 2.6.20.

Second, apply aioepoll-2.6.20.diff in the patches directory.

Third, rebuild the kernel and reboot with the new kernel. Note you
need to enable SCSI_TGT, SCSI_SRP, and SCSI_IBMVSCSIS kernel options
in order to use the IBM VIO target driver, 

Now you are ready to build target drivers. If you like to use the
iSCSI target driver:

host:~/tgt/usr$ make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src-directory> ISCSI=1

Or if you like to use the IBM VIO target driver:

host:~/tgt/usr$ make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src-directory> IBMVIO=1

Make sure that everything is built successfully.

Now you can run tgt. Target drivers have their own ways for
configuration. So find an appropriate documentation in the doc
directory.
