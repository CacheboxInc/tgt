Subject: [PATCH] block layer: kill length alignment test in bin_map_user

The tgt project is mapping in bios using bio_map_user. The current targets
do not need their len to be aligned with a queue limit so this check is
causing some problems.

The major user, blk_bio_map_user checks for the len before mapping
and is not affected by this patch.

And the semi-newly added user blk_rq_map_user_iov has been failing
out when the len is not aligned properly so maybe people have been
good and not sending misaligned lens or that path is not used very
often and this change will not be very dangerous. st and sg do not
check the length and we have not seen any problem reports from those
wider used paths so this patch should be fairly safe - for mm 
and wider testing at least.
