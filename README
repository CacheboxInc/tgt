Introduction
-------------
Note that linux target framework software (tgt) is under active
development. Don't play with important data.

Currently, tgt supports two SCSI targets, iSCSI software target
(istgt) and IBM virtual SCSI target (ibmvstgt).


Starting
-------------
The software consists of kernel modules and user-space tools (daemon,
management tool, dynamic libraries). The compilation of the kernel
modules require the path to above kernel sources:

host:~/tgt$ make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src>

Make sure that everything is built successfully. Now you can start tgt
by type the followings.

host:~/tgt$ su
host:~/tgt# ./initd start

You need to be in the tgt source code directory to execute the script
correctly.

You can see /sys/class/tgt_type directory to make sure kernel modules
loaded.

host:~/tgt# cat /sys/class/tgt_type/driver1/name
istgt
host:~/tgt# cat /sys/class/tgt_type/driver1/protocol
scsi

The number in the directory path is driver id. The istgt driver id is
1 in the above example.

By defaults, tgt generates logs of debug messages. Please see
/var/log/kern.log and /var/log/daemon.log (your Linux distributions
may use the different log file names).


Configuration
-------------
Everyting is configured via the tgtadm management tool. Currenlty, tgt
does not support persistent configurations. The tgtadm alayws requires
you to specify the driver name like the following examples.

host:~/tgt# ./usr/tgtadm --driver istgt --help
host:~/tgt# ./usr/tgtadm --driver ibmvstgt --help

First, you need to create a target.

host:~/tgt# ./usr/tgtadm --driver istgt --op new --tid 0 \
--params Name=iqn.2001-04.com.example:storage.disk1.sys1.xyz

If you use ibmvstgt, you don't need to create a target because they
are created automatically. A target is created per virtual bus.

You can see /sys/class/tgt_target directory to make sure the target is
ready.

host:~/tgt# cat /sys/class/tgt_target/target0/typeid
1

This number is the driver id. That is, this target (tid 0) belongs to
the driver id 1.

The number in the directory path is target id (tid). tid is 0 in the
above example.

Then, you need to add a device to the target (tid 0).

host:~/tgt# ./usr/tgtadm --driver istgt --op new --tid 0 --lun 0 \
--params Path=/dev/sdb1,Type=tgt_vsd

You can see /sys/class/tgt_device directory to make sure the device
was added successfully.

host:~/tgt# cat /sys/class/tgt_device/device0\:0/size
9006649344

Note that every target must need a device whose lun is zero. Now the
target is ready for accepting accesses from initiators.


Stopping
-------------
Simply execute:

host:~/tgt# ./initd stop
