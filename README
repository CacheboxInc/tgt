Introduction
-------------
Note that linux target framework (tgt) is under active
development. Don't play with important data.

Currently, tgt supports only one low level driver, IBM VIO server
(ibmvstgt).


Starting
-------------
The software consists of kernel modules and user-space tools (daemon,
management tool, dynamic libraries).

First, get kernel sources from James's scsi-rc-fixes-2.6 git tree.

The kernel itself requires the patches in the patchset
directory. Apply all the patches except the 6th patch, rebuild the
kernel, and reboot with the new kernel.

The compilation of the kernel modules require the path to above kernel
source:

host:~/use-scsi-ml$ make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src>

Make sure that everything is built successfully. Now you can load the
kernel modules by typing the followings.

host:~/use-scsi-ml$ su
host:~/use-scsi-ml# ./initd start

See /var/log/kern.log (your Linux distributions may use the different
log file name) to make sure that the kernel modules are loaded
properly. You should see messages like the followings:

Feb 27 19:37:52 lilac kernel: IBM eServer i/pSeries Virtual SCSI Target Driver
Feb 27 19:37:52 lilac kernel: vio_register_driver: driver ibmvscsi registering
Feb 27 19:37:52 lilac kernel: scsi1 : ibmvstgt

You need the scsi host number (it is 1 in this example) in the next
stage (configuration).


Configuration
-------------

Everyting is configured via the tgtadm management tool. Currenlty, tgt
does not support persistent configurations. You can use a makeshift
script, 'ibmv' to do the necessary job.

Note that the ibmv script exports /dev/sdb1 to initiators as LUN 0 by
defaults. You MUST change the device path if your /dev/sdb1 stores
important data or your box does not have /dev/sdb1.

host:~/use-scsi-ml# ./ibmv 1

You need to specify the scsi host number as the first argument.

Please see /var/log/daemon.log (your Linux distributions may use the
different log file name again) to make sure that everything is
fine. You should see something like the followings:

Feb 27 22:36:40 lilac tgtd: dl_init(71) istgt library is not loaded.
Feb 27 22:36:40 lilac tgtd: dl_init(71) ibmvstgt library is not loaded.
Feb 27 22:37:08 lilac tgtd: tgt_target_create(572) Succeed to create a new target 1
Feb 27 22:37:08 lilac tgtd: tgt_target_bind(517) Succeed to bind the target 1 to the scsi host 1
Feb 27 22:37:08 lilac tgtd: tgt_device_create(238) Succeed to add a logical unit 0 to the target 1


Now you are ready. Boot up VIO clients.

Note that the tgt kernel modules enable the debug option by
defaults. We are not ready for improving performance.


Stopping
-------------
Simply execute:

host:~/use-scsi-ml# ./initd stop
